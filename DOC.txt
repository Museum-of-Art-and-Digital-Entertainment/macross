/u0/chip/macross:
	This directory contains the source to Macross.  Here's what's here:

DOC			- this file

Makefile		- current makefile
Makefile_6502		- makefile for 6502 version
Makefile_68000		- makefile for 68000

	There are both 6502 and 68000 versions of Macross, though the 68000
version has not been very well tested.  Source for both is here.  Source files
which come in different flavors for the different versions are marked 6502 or
68000 in their names as appropriate.  There are two different Makefiles also.
At any given time, either the 6502 version or the 68000 version is the
'working' version.  The 'working' version is what the default makefile
'Makefile' will produce.  Typing 'make foobar' will change the working version
by swapping the makefiles.

*.c, *.h, *.y		- source for the program

doc/			- the manual and other user documentation are here
notes68/		- notes on 68000 syntax and operand structure
opt/			- working directory for 'optimized' version.  When I
	was developing the program, I needed to keep two separate copies of
	the source and object code.  This is because the C compiler can
	compile with debugging or with optimization, but not both.  The
	version that folks use needs to be compiled with optimization, but I
	need a version with debugging to fix any problems that crop up.  Since
	the time to recompile the whole thing is so enormous, it was easiest
	to keep two copies.  In the interest of saving file space, all that is
	in this directory now, however, are the Makefiles for compiling with
	optimization.
